title: Adding a custom search engine to Chrome
---
You can add a custom search engine to Chrome that you can activate with a keyword. Just replace the query string parameter in the URL with "\%s" and Chrome will substitute it in when you do the search.

Go to Settings -> Search -> Manage Search Engines

Add your search engine at the bottom.

![]({{site.cdn_path}}/2014/11/13/1.jpg)

Then, type your keyword in the address bar to activate it.

![]({{site.cdn_path}}/2014/11/13/2.jpg)
