## Introduction

This is an attempt to start writing about my research and learning journey throughout my master's in search of my master's thesis topic. 

As instructed and supported by **Doctor**, starting this post will help me develop the habit of writing and formulating everything I learn and come across that may benefit my thesis. 

**Doctor** gave me a number of introductory papers to initiate the process, and with that, I have started.

## Uncertainty in Machine Learning

### Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty

Aleatoric uncertainty is **irreducible**: it is intrinsic to the quantity we are measuring. No matter how much additional data we collect, it remains.

Epistemic uncertainty is **reducible**: it arises from data/model limitations and can be reduced with more data or better modeling.

---

### Formal Definitions

Let \( x \in X \) be inputs and \( y \in Y \) outputs.

#### Aleatoric Uncertainty:

\[
Y \mid x \sim f_{Y|x}(y \mid x)
\]

#### Epistemic Uncertainty:

Defined as the remaining uncertainty not captured by aleatoric uncertainty. It can be decomposed further into model, data, and estimation uncertainties.

#### Total Uncertainty:

\[
\text{Total Uncertainty} = \text{Aleatoric Uncertainty} + \text{Epistemic Uncertainty}
\]

*Statistical & Probabilistic Inference in ML*

### Kullback–Leibler Divergence

Measures the "distance" between two distributions \( P \) (true) and \( Q \) (approximation):

\[
\text{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \sum P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \quad \text{(discrete)}
\]
\[
\text{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \int P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} dx \quad \text{(continuous)}
\]

> KL divergence is **not symmetric**, and equals zero only when \( P = Q \).

### Fisher Information

Quantifies how much information a sample provides about a parameter.

#### Definitions:

1. **Variance of the Score Function**:

\[
I(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ S(\theta) S(\theta)^T \right]
\quad \text{where } S(\theta) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log p(X | \theta)
\]

2. **Negative Expectation of the Hessian**:

\[
I(\theta) = -\mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial \theta^T} \log p(X | \theta) \right]
\]

---

#### Interpretation:

- **High Fisher Info** → Low uncertainty in \( \hat{\theta} \)
- **Low Fisher Info** → High uncertainty

---

### Cramér-Rao Lower Bound:

\[
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) \geq I(\theta)^{-1}
\]

The inverse of Fisher Information provides a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator.
