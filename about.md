Do you post on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter? If so, then you're creating content for those sites. For free. They make ad dollars while you get validation via likes. [This link](<https://www.alwaysownyourplatform.com/>) says it a lot better than I can.

This site is an effort to make sure that all the content I create for various platforms is pushed from here to them. That way, I have everything I write and create in one place. The big social media platforms are not the only repositories for it.
