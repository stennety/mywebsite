I"Ô<p>I came across an article that claimed a piece of analysis failed because of â€˜badâ€™ data.</p>

<p>It reminded me of a phrase I used to hear on the trading floor, â€œUS non-farm payrolls beat estimatesâ€.</p>

<p>Is it possible for data to be inherently good or bad? I am not convinced. The state of data should only be that they 
exist, and are held as the truth because they exist.</p>

<p>There must be another reason to explain the systemâ€™s unexpected performance. Consider the following paradigm.</p>

<p>Input -&gt; System -&gt; Output</p>

<p>When applied to a machine learning or data science project might give something like the following 4 steps.</p>

<p>Source datasets â€“ move datasets from there to here â€“ do something useful with data â€“ show something useful to the world</p>

<p>Putting my paranoid/Trader cap on, 4 steps mean 4 modes of failure.</p>

<p>The rest of this blog shall pay close attention to mode 2. Otherwise labelled as DevOps, data architecture, data engineering. I never know which one to use so Iâ€™ll stick with â€˜move datasets from there to hereâ€™.</p>

<p>The aim of this blog is to challenge myself and hopefully the reader to think about big data systems at a layer of abstraction that remains invariant in time.</p>

<p>Learn to fish and youâ€™ll never be hungry, or something like that.</p>

<p>Stick around and you can expect to explore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Database principles</li>
  <li>Types of failure</li>
  <li>Lambda architecture</li>
  <li>Where todayâ€™s tools fit in</li>
</ul>
