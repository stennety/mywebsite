I really appreciate the fact that we’re getting more aware of the racist core of our society. But, we must be careful to not let ourselves become as terrible as those we oppose. There are some good quotes about the so-called liberal media below.

[First](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-news-media-is-destroying-itself), Matt Taibbi makes some good points about the “liberal” media:

> The media in the last four years has devolved into a succession of moral manias. We are told the Most Important Thing Ever is happening for days or weeks at a time, until subjects are abruptly dropped and forgotten, but the tone of warlike emergency remains: from James Comey’s firing, to the deification of Robert Mueller, to the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, to the democracy-imperiling threat to intelligence “whistleblowers,” all those interminable months of Ukrainegate hearings (while Covid-19 advanced), to fury at the death wish of lockdown violators, to the sudden reversal on that same issue, etc.
> 
> It’s been learned in these episodes we may freely misreport reality, so long as the political goal is righteous.

[Second](https://newrepublic.com/article/158206/gentlemanly-haters-guide-gone-wind), Drew Magary watched “Gone With The Wind”:

> This is a raw look at how white filmmakers and white audiences thought, back in 1939\. Going by that Amazon spike, this is what many white audiences want to watch _right now._ Being fanned by slaves represents the good old days for them. No wonder so many wingnuts rushed to prop up this Kentucky Derby party of a movie.

Drew’s take on Scarlett O’Hara:

> She’s dead inside. She’s clinging to a sepia-toned past that she cannot resurrect, but is willing to kill on the off-chance she might be able to. Remind you of other people you know?

[Third](https://www.cracked.com/article_28042_badass-protest-dogs-from-around-world.html), there are some very impressive dogs out there, fighting the power all day e’ryday:

> The hound always seems to side with the protesters, whatever the dispute." He was also "unfazed even by water cannon[s]" and "appear[s] to be immune to the effects of tear gas…

> …the dog we're talking about is called ["Negro Matapacos"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_Matapacos) or "Black Cop-Killer" (because he's black and dislikes cop, not because he's racist).
