I had a little less screen-time this year. The web felt a little less open and web-like. I didn’t feel the motivation to create or post as often. 

Content takes time to put together and it has become a little frustrating that algorithms are now firmly in the middle, deciding to show content that I have shared and made available. The non-chronological feed is a lottery. If you are reading this, you made it, thank you. Read on…

## 2017s Output

### CodePen
* [AnimeJS Logo Bounce](https://codepen.io/plfstr/pen/OmVWgN) CodePen demo. My logo ricochets around, using the ‘SVG motion path’ function.
* I upped my JS game, learned ES6 and re-wrote one of my earliest CodePens with ES6 to see the difference, [Much Content? (ES6 Fork)](https://codepen.io/plfstr/details/GvQmNz?preview_height=250).
* [Hop Over Notification](/blog/hop-over-navigation/) has now passed 35,000 views (~20K since 2016), plus my [top 5 popular pens](https://codepen.io/plfstr/popular/) passed 60,000 views collectively.

### Side Projects
* Colordinates, my geoposition colour app, is now [included in the PWA Directory](/blog/colordinates-in-pwa-directory/) of Progressive Web Apps.
* Moved this site to HTTPS (see the padlock?) and faster hosting, I continue to try and [improve performance](/blog/lightening-the-load/).
* Migrated [blackandwhitesquares.com](/work/blackandwhitesquares/) 1500+ posts away from Tumblr and archived the project as a static website. 

### Posted
* With people relying on browsers ‘Reader View’ to get the content they want, faster and without distractions, is a [Read Only Web](/blog/read-only-web) ahead?
* Posted about [Lite Club](https://wp.me/p8cZJl-1cD), and the new trend of companies offering light-weight versions of their services.
* Wrote some impromptu posts participating in the WordPress.com [Daily Inspiration](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/tag/dailyprompt/) post. Plus other [personal posts](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/tag/personal/).

## I/O

This year was expended effort behind the scenes. Site migrations and archiving, learning an updated modern Javascript ES6 and new layout method with CSS Grid etc. 

With the extra time, I was designing, coding and learning. I have a list of web technologies I need to take on, and I ticked a lot more from my list than ever. Next year I aim to release some new projects and have more things people will get to see and use. See you in 2018!
