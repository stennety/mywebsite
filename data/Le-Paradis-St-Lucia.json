The project was to be developed in four phases but stalled in 2008 due to the Global Financial Crisis, going into receivership in 2009 with Phase 1 at 52% completion.</p><p>Sotheby's has the property for sale at $29,000,000 USD. Renowned golf course architect <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://gngcd.com/courses/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Greg Norman</a> routed the golf course and started the construction process with only clearance, final shaping and grassing remaining.  Island neighbor <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://cabotsaintlucia.com/golf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Point Hardy Golf Club at Cabot St. Lucia</a> has opened as one the best 100 golf courses in the world as recognized by US Golf Magazine.</p><p>The rebirth of Le Paradis is a positive development for St. Lucia and will be a valuable asset to the community providing a place for people to relax and enjoy the beauty of St. Lucia.</p>"
