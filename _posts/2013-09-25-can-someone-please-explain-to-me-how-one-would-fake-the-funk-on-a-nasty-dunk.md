[Can someone please explain to me how one would fake the funk on a nasty dunk?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1n0uhu/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_how_one_would/):

> From urbandictionary - Fake the Funk: (v.) To act with a false ethos surrounding oneself in an attempt to win respect from a certain influential party.
> 
> In layman's terms, it's an act similar to being someone you're not just to impress others.

> In the great realm of basketball (one that is riddled with questionable catchy phrases), we can only conclude that faking the funk on a nasty dunk would be something similar to going up with a dunk that is not representative of your own character. As one scholar describes, "Faking the funk is exuding a bravado that is not commensurate with your qualifications."
> 
> We turn, then, to the inherent problem: how one can fake the funk on a "nasty dunk". As I'm sure the majority of this audience knows, a nasty dunk is not one that is noxious or unpleasant - interestingly, this fits one of the classical definitions of irony: the use of a word to convey a meaning that is the opposite of its literal meaning.
> 
> So the problem lies, of course, that a "nasty dunk" would inherently contain a certain level of funk. To imply that someone is able to fake the funk on a nasty dunk is, in its sense, someone that is performing a great dunk that is out of character. Used in example - Tim Duncan performing a "Honey Dip" dunk immortalized by Vince Carter from the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest. The "Honey Dip" is a "nasty dunk" but one that is out of character for the stoic Timothy Theodore Duncan.
