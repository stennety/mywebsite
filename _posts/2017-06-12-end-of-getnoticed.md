Hello!

GetNoticed competition ended with the start of June. I didn't make it to the finalists' list, but I still am proud that I managed to do something. What's next? Will I abandon writing/coding OSII? Definitely not! I've had some busy time with music, so I stepped back a little, but also "cleared my mind" with something new, which I will write about. I still want to finish at least ZMTP part of OSII, I still want to write - end of competition changes only the recurring times of blog posts. I will try to write at least once a week now - not twice as stated in competition rules.

That's it for now! See you soon! :)
