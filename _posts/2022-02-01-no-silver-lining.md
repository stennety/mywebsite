A quote by Krusty the Clown from the Simpsons episode, "[Bart the Fink](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bart_the_Fink/Quotes)":

> There's no silver lining here. I was a big cheese! A huge cheese! But now, look at me. I gotta ride the bus like a schnook! I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot! I gotta wait in line with nobodies to buy groceries from a failure!
