Yesterday was one of the most shameful days in American history. We saw a group of domestic terrorists storm the Capitol and face no real consequences. This country is broken, and I don’t know how we can fix it.

[First](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/a-poster-makes-good), the great and now resurrected Today In Tabs newsletter perfectly described Kelly Loeffler:
> The less-surprising race was between **the Reverend Raphael Warnock**, [holder of at least two Masters degrees and one Doctorate and pastor at Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s church](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/06/who-is-raphael-warnock/), and incumbent **Kelly Loeffler**, a coat rack brought to life by an evil wizard, dressed up in a trucker hat, and gifted a Senate seat. Loeffler's main accomplishments are [being married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kelly-loeffler-georgia-runoff-husband-billionaire-b1782611.html) and [buying shares in a bodybag producer](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kelly-loeffler-and-david-perdue-profiting-off-pandemic-pain-are-the-ugly-faces-of-gop-corruption) when she heard about the coming pandemic. Loeffler, who is so egregiously villainous that the players on the WNBA team she owns [have been wearing "Vote Warnock" t-shirts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/sports/basketball/wnba-dream-loeffler-warnock.html), has so far refused to concede the race. At press time she was sitting down to her customary breakfast of Dalmation puppies and was unavailable for comment.

Second, this is what the police are about:

Third, this is the epitome of the privilege of the white terrorists from today:
