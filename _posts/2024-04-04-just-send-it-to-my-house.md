<p>A man called in about evicting his adult stepdaughter from his home. Stepdaughter was originally supposed to stay for two weeks while she found a new job, and then was to get her own apartment. Six weeks had now passed, and stepdaughter was whiling away her days sleeping and watching TV. He asked what the usual eviction process was. I explained that a letter would usually be sent to the tenant, along with a notice of eviction being attached to the apartment door.</p>

**Man**: So, can you send a letter to [stepdaughter]?<br>
**Me**: Let me get this straight. You want me to send a letter to evict your adult stepdaughter from your house. Meaning the letter will be sent to your house?<br>
**Man**: Yeah.<br>
**Me**: Just curious: How does [stepdaughter] receive her mail?<br>
**Man**: My wife hands it to her.<br>
**Me**: So, your wife will hand an eviction letter to [stepdaughter]?<br>
**Man**: Yeah.<br>
**Me**: This will not end well.<br>
**Man**: I have to do it!<br>

<p>About a month later, the man called in because stepdaughter had gone nuts after getting the letter. He now wanted to sue her for the damage to his dishes and other breakables that were damaged during the ensuing altercation between stepdaughter and wife.</p>
