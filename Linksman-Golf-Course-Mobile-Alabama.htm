				<H1>Cypress Creek Golf Course - Jerry Pate Design</H1> 
				<p>Cypress Creek Golf Course at Riviére du Chien Park is a public municipal golf course located in Mobile, Alabama. The original design was named Old Linksman Golf Course designed by Ralph Sharp opening in 1972.  Back tees on the course measured 6,275 yards and has a revised par of 70.  Forward tees measured 5416 yards.  The course had water in play on 14 holes and was known for its location with views of the Dog River and Mobile Bay.  Linksman Golf Course was closed in 2006.  In 2021, Mobile County purchased the land for $850,000 with plans to rebuild the course.</p>
				<p>Project <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.mobilecountyal.gov/uploads/2023-05-03MCCGolfCourseReAdvertisement-GolfCoursePhaseMCPI-GC001.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>construction bid</a> was awarded to Mid-America Golf for a budget of $13.7 million.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.mid-americagolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mid-America Golf</a> is forecasting a reopening in summer of 2025 to rebuild the golf course.  This comprehensive golf course rebuild project encompasses a wide array of construction and landscaping tasks, aimed at enhancing both the aesthetic presentation with an additional emphasis on grassing and bunker finish.</p>
				<p>Reconstruction of all greens to be built in accordance with United States Golf Association (USGA) specification.  All fairways and tees will be regrassed. All bunkers will be reconstructed.  A pivotal component of the renovation is the installation of a completely new irrigation system across the entire golf course ensuring maintenance capabilities.  Landscape design will need to be environmentally sustainable, minimizing water waste while maintaining lush, healthy turf.  Demolition of pavement cart paths will make way for the construction of new, durable concrete cart paths.  Comprehensive drainage solutions throughout the golf course addressing water management and wetlands preservation are on the project timeline.</p>
				<p>An extensive clearing and mass grading effort will facilitate the expansion of existing water features including the creation of new hazards adding to the course's beauty and the game's strategy and lateral hazards.  Jerry Pate Design has chosen seven new timber golf cart path bridges to blend seamlessly the natural environment.  To support this ambitious project, a timeline of four hundred and seventy-five (475) calendar days has been allocated for completion.</p>
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.jerrypatedesign.com/projects/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jerry Pate Design</a> is the golf architect selected for the renovation of Linksman Golf Course. Pate is a former professional golfer who won the 1976 U.S. Open. He has also designed or renovated more than 20 golf courses, including the Country Club of Mobile and the Pensacola Country Club.  Pate's design for Cypress Creek will retain the original character of the course.</p>
