## Tester of The day Winners Interviews

We have classics, like the [interview from winner number 1, Chris McMahon](https://interviews.testeroftheday.com/interviews/2021/02/13/chris-mcmahon.html). Chris goes into some really excellent depth and his story about his favorite bug is not to be missed!

## Nicola Lindgren Interviews

[Nicola](https://twitter.com/NicolaLindgren) has been interviewing Testers since 2013! Starting with [an interview with Markus Gaertner](https://nicolalindgren.com/2013/05/30/interview-with-markus-gaertner/), with hard hitting questions like "Where do you see software testing going in the next 5 years?" and "When your friends (outside of IT) ask you “What do you do as a software tester?”, what do you tell them?" it's worth a read to learn what Markus has to say.

And don't let the early start fool you, Nicola is still active in 2022, if anything more so with 7 interviews so far this year, phew! The [latest interview is with the amazing Lisi Hocke](https://nicolalindgren.com/2022/05/14/interview-with-lisi-hocke/), discussing ensemble testing.

## Testing Tales with The Pirate Tester

[Lee "Ahoy there" Marshall](https://twitter.com/ThePirateTester), aka The Pirate Tester, takes on a different approach with video series [Testing Tales](https://twitter.com/ThePirateTester). Lee has already posted interviews with 5 amazing people, including at least one "not a tester", [Bob Salmon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LhwCzsYDco&list=PLk1f2uumbghTWUgX8KKE5qwy7mxIMFa35&index=2).

Full disclosure, I've done an interview with Lee myself, spoiler alert it maybe some weeks before it is posted as he has a terrific backlog of videos to edit and post. So make sure you like and subscribe, as the YouTubers love to say.
