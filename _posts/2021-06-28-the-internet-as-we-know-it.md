[This](https://www.nooctothorpe.com/blog/2021/6/4/hey-so-i-think-i-fucking-hate-the-internet) is a very accurate reflection of my feelings about the Internet at large: 

> This is all exacerbated by the fact that the current state of the Internet and social media essentially renders it an emotional outlet plugged directly into each person’s id. It rewards extreme behavior, and people crave to be a part of something bigger than themselves, so of course they get pulled into taking part in a mob of like-minded individuals who are all saying similar things. It's easy to get swept up in a sea of validation. I found myself there so many times, and only later, once the storm dissipated, did I sit back and consider the consequences of my own actions in that situation.
