On Saturday, a group of friends and I went on a 9-mile trek along the abandoned Tillamook Railroad about 35 miles west of Portland. This railroad was originally constructed in 1906, but was damaged by storms in 1996 and subsequently fell into disrepair. It made for a nice, easy fall hike because of the fall colors, sun, and minimal elevation gain.
 
This route seemed to be the most popular, based on what I'd read, so we opted for that:

Here's the actual GPS tracks from our route: [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1376988953)

I brought a drone and GoPro along, and cut this video together from the footage we shot with those:
