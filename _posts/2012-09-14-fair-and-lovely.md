I was in Bangladesh back in 2006. I am much lighter skinned than most of the people in that country. 

While I was there, my 20 year old cousins had several friends over for a birthday party. While we were talking, I let slip that I used 3-4 tubes of Fair and Lovely every day and had done so for the past 10 years. Thus, I had much lighter skin. All of the girls ooh'ed and aah'ed, delighted to see someone they knew who had gotten such great results using such a product. 

I'm sure they would have bought all of the Fair and Lovely in the country had I not told them it was all a joke.
