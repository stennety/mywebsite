				<H1>Ouli Farms - Kona Golf - Hawaii</H1>
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.oulifarms.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ouli Farms</a> is an 840 acre development located on the Kohala coast on Kona, the Big Island of Hawaii.  The property is just to the north of the Mauna Kea Resort on the west coast of Kona. The site was part of the original parcel acquired by the Rockefeller family.</p>
				<p>The development will include approximately 140 homes with planning for over 200 acres of active farms.  Each home includes an acre as an active farm contributing to the food production on the island.  The farms will be managed by a team of experienced farmers producing a variety of fruits, vegetables, and flowers.  In addition to the homes and farms, Ouli Farms will also include a community club. The club will offer a variety of amenities, such as a swimming pool, tennis courts, and a fitness center.</p>
				<p>Ouli Farms is designed to prioritize sustainability and environmental stewardship.  Minimizing its impact on the environment, residents will use sustainable practices throughout.   Homes  will be built with energy-efficient materials, and the farms will be managed using organic methods.</p>
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href="https://oulifarms.com/team/">Founders</a> Joe Root and <a style='font-weight:bold' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/punoose/">George Punoose</a> have planned for the community to have a golf course integrated into the natural landscape.  Punoose was previously at Cabot St. Lucia's <a style='font-weight:bold' href="https://golf.com/travel/cabot-st-lucia-point-hardy-mythical-opening-2023/">Point Hardy</a> Golf Club, which has a Top 100 in the World golf course designed by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw.</p>
				<p>The Kohala Coast of Kona is known for its sunny, pleasant weather with average annual rainfall of 10 inches. The climate is mild with average temperatures from 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter to 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.</p>
