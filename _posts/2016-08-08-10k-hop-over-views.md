[Hop Over Notification Badge](/blog/hop-over-navigation/) has flown past [Excerpt Peek](/blog/excerpt-peek/) to the top of [my most popular pens](https://codepen.io/plfstr/pens/popular) on the code demo site, CodePen, with 10,000+ views. The effect got more attention due to featuring in a post on Envato, ‘[A Collection of Pure CSS Animation Snippets & Demos](http://marketblog.envato.com/inspirations/pure-css-animation-snippets/)’.

I was particularly pleased with this CSS effect and to-date I have seen few like it featuring a z-index change. It was tricky to code the effect successfully cross-browser. 

This is an effect I later revamped with [Action Button Intro](/blog/action-button-intro/) to bring the effect to the Material Design Lite framework where it can highlight an apps primary action button.

Thanks to everyone who has taken a look and included the effect in their work.
