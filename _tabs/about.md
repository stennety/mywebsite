I am currently a Quality Engineer [@adahealth](https://twitter.com/adahealth), where I work across the Medical Platform group, working alongside Software Engineers, AI Scientists and Medical Knowledge Engineers.

I started my adventure into software testing and exploring quality ten years ago in 2012. In this time I have developed a keen sense of [what quality means to me](https://www.dowen.me.uk/posts/what-does-quality-mean-to-me/ "What quality means to me"), and [reflected on my various roles](https://www.dowen.me.uk/posts/when-is-a-tester-not-a-tester/ "When is a software tester not a software tester").

I have worked in a range of domains, across Enterprise Virtualisation, Consultancy, Racing and Betting and now Health Technology. Demonstrating skills in various technologies hosted on platforms including bare metal and virtualisation up to enterprise solutions to modern cloud infrastructure.

I've worked on modern NodeJS micro-services running high performance event driven architectures. mobile and web apps, backend APIs and AI powered libraries.

I use a combination of test analysis, automation and tool building and collaborative exploratory testing to support teams to build better software.

I support the testing community, [advocating for software testing](https://youtu.be/lZgtN0d9i4w "Ben talking with Karen Tests Stuff on YouTube"), and celebrated those in the community via [Tester of The Day.](https://www.testeroftheday.com "Tester of The Day")

## Portfolio

My portfolio is work in progress, at this time it is a good landing page to my various projects and social media presence. Over time I will develop it further.
