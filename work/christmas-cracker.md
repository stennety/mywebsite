Tasked with advertising Ideal World’s upcoming ‘Christmas in August’ bank holiday weekend event as a direct mailing. 

The design tied in with the events TV branding and evoked the luxurious feel of the promotion. A luxury christmas cracker box design played along with the event name and when it landed through customers letter boxes, gave the impression of a surprise gift.

It was a great excuse to do some illustration and my first direct mail piece. The design was produced as a run of 90,000 direct mailing postcards and package inserts.
