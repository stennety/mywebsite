title: How to import GPX data from a legacy Garmin 60CSX
---
I borrowed a friend's old GPSmap 60CSx to build an elevation profile of a hike that we had gone on. The device was purchased in 2006 and not supported out-of-the-box by any Garmin software I could find. After trying out several programs to import data, [EasyGPS](http://www.easygps.com/download.asp) for Windows worked the best. I ran it in a VM on my Mac. After I installed the USB drivers for the GPSmap, it was able to import all the tracks and waypoints from the device.
