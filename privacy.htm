What personal data we collect and why we collect it

Cookies
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. youtube, pinterest, wordpress.org, etc.). Embedded content from other websites executes in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited that website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

Analytics
We use Google analytics and Bing Webmaster Tools from Microsoft to record information about the pages a user has seen, for example the URL of the page, time of day, device used, etc. The information that we collect is anonymized and sent to Google Analytics/Bing Webmaster Tools from Microsoft for analysis.
Google Analytics/Bing Webmaster Tools from Microsoft also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give website owners a sense of which country, state, or city in the world their users come from (also known as “IP geolocation”).
Google Analytics/Bing Webmaster Tools from Microsoft uses first-party cookies to report on visitor interactions on this website. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.

Who we share your data with
We will never sell, rent, or lease your Personal Data to a third party.

How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
