Since this past October, I’ve been in a state of constant anxiety. First it was the election. Then it was the terrorist attack on January 6\. Then, it was the impeachment. But, I realize now that there’s no sense in me worrying about these things. I can’t control them. It also helps to have an actual human being as president, instead of the sentient Youtube comments section we’ve had to endure over the past 4 years.

So I’m back. I’ll do my best to keep the issues flowing. You do your best to keep reading them.

[First](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/children-of-qanon-believers_n_601078e9c5b6c5586aa49077), people who lose their loved ones to QAnon are part of a collective grief over the fact free triumphing in our marketplace of ideas:

> QAnon draws its adherents into an imagined battle of good versus evil that is prophesied to culminate in an apocalyptic reckoning. In its mission to prevail over a satanic cabal of liberal elites, it promotes themes of Christian nationalism, including patriotism and the preservation of traditional American values. QAnon believers also spend a great deal of time poring over Q’s cryptic 8kun posts, or “Q Drops,” which are often steeped in Scripture, like sacred texts bearing hidden truths. And above all, QAnon demands unwavering faith in a higher power.

[Second](https://bitchesgottaeat.substack.com/p/whos-on-judge-mathis-today-180), Samantha Irby’s newsletter of Judge Mathis episode reviews is some of the funniest stuff I’ve read in years:

> first of all, that’s sibling business. unless jane’s husband was around in 1986 when that bitch threw a bike at me on the corner of ridge and main street then taunted me all the way home he couldn’t possibly understand the layers of stale resentment we are assaulting each other over! sibling fights are rarely about the disagreement at hand, they’re always sprinkled with some old shit, grudges that we’ve been holding onto for years. let us work that shit out with our fists! and second, i know my sister had her left knee replaced and exactly how to kick her in it, i don’t need anyone else messing up my plan of attack! kendiel should’ve just hit her brother over the head with the monopoly board and got a sitter from care dot com!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Third](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/news/a42222/rep-maxine-waters-will-read-you-now/), I would like to meet Maxine Waters and learn her ways:

> Rep. Waters is definitely that auntie who got rich selling Avon and doesn't really like your father.
