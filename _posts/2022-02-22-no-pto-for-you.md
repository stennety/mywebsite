title: No PTO for you
---

When I worked for a small company, all the mothers would take tons of time off when school was off or their kids had something going on. The work we did required us to be in the office. So, on the days the mothers took off, the rest of us had to pick up the slack.

A couple of years in, I decided to see when the local schools were on Spring Break. I put those days into the calendar as time off for me. This happened in January. As late March approached, the mothers figured out what I'd done.

They demanded to know what I was doing that week. I made the mistake of saying that I was just staying home. They told me that they needed that time off and I was being selfish. When I refused to budge, they went to the owner, who revoked my time off.
