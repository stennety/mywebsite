title: Best of 2020 
---
Well, despite a global pandemic that forced us all into lockdown, I managed to maintain my sanity and mostly stay on track with the goals I'd set. Here's how I did.

# Health

## Fitness

I'd initially set a goal to run 25 miles a week, but scrapped that after I got the spin bike. That shifted to just "do some form of cardio 5 or 6 days a week."

You can see from this graph that I briefly was up to running 25 miles per week, but that fell to about 10 per week after I got the spin bike. My spin biking has gradually climbed to 80 miles per week. My goal for Q3 is to pass my AWS developer certification, and I've been watching a Udemy course for that while I ride. So I've shifted to just running once or twice a week. I'll likely pick back up that mileage after I pass the exam.

# Career

My tech reading this quarter was "Java: Concurrency in Practice." I finished it, and will write a blog post on it this weekend. 

I also set a goal to get in the habit of checking dashboards every morning for services I'm in charge of. I averaged 3.3x/week for that, which is 66%. But that trends upwards, meaning that I got better at it toward the end of the quarter. This habit resulted in me finding and fixing several issues much more quickly than I otherwise would have, so I'm going to continue it next quarter.

# Finance

I met 58% of my savings goal. Not great, but there were some necessary pandemic purchases that put a dent in that, like a spin bike, bike carrier for stocking up on groceries, home organization purchases, etc. With those out of the way, it'll be easier to meet this goal next quarter.

# Media

(This part is just for fun)

## Books

I read 2,273 pages in 7 books over the course of the quarter.

Here's the breakdown by page count:

And by recommender. 43% of the books I read were recommended by my dad, and 14% by my sister.

## Video games

I played 3 video games this quarter. Animal Crossing was one I chipped away at over the course of April and May, where Last of Us II I got into and beat about a week after I bought it.

I really enjoyed Outer Wilds, which was recommended by a coworker. This game started off as a master's thesis and was such a clever way to tell a story. Essentially, you explore this solar system and piece together what happened to an extinct race of intelligent life that came before you.

# Notes

- I used [Tableau](https://tableau.com/) for these visualizations.
- I used [Productive](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477) to track habits.
