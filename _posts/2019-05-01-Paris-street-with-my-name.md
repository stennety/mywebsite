# Rue du Helder in Paris

I usually travel a lot to Paris for work (the HQ of the company I work for is in Paris) and last April I went as usual to Paris and by chance I found one street with my name in Paris! It was very funny to find out a place with my name in there.

It seems that the origins of this street is not related to the Portuguese name Helder, like mine, it is related to the battle of Fort Helder, which the English army had tried to remove from the French in 1799. Helder is a port in Netherlands, located in North Holland opposite the island of Texel. I found one reference in [French wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_du_Helder) with this information.

It is a fun fact!
