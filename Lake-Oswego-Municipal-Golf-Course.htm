				<p>The City of Lake Oswego Municipal Golf Course is currently undergoing a 2 year renovation project with expected completion date in late 2024.

				<p>The new maintenance facility is being rebuilt on the north side of the property adjacent to Stafford Road.  A major part of the maintenanace budget and upgrade for the grounds is a new irrigation system.  Total cost of the municipal renovation project is estimated to be $12 million and is overseen by the City's Parks and Recreation Department.</p>

Henninger is an Oregon native and member of the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame.  He is familiar with the Lake Oswego course and is quoted: 'I'm excited to be involved in the renovation of the Lake Oswego Municipal Golf Course. It's a great course with a lot of potential, and I think we can make it even better. I'm looking forward to working with the City and the design team to create a course that's challenging and enjoyable for golfers of all skill levels.'</p>
