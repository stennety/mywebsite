	                <h1>Midland County Municipal Golf Course</h1>

        	        <p>Multiple golf courses in Midland have closed down in the past decade. The Nuvo Vista golf course has been lost due to the Preserve at Midland project.  Ranchland Hills golf course is in the process of being converted into two new high schools by Midland Independent School District.</p>
                	<p>Midland has Hogan Park golf course as it's only public course.  Midland Country Club and Green Tree Country Club are private golf clubs.</p>
                	<p>In 2024, Midland county commissioners started to consider the need for a new municipal golf course. A request for proposal (RFP) for companies to conduct a <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.co.midland.tx.us/DocumentCenter/View/7341/24MCO626-Golf-Course-Feasibility-Study' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>feasibility study</a>. The initiative was led by county commissioners Scott Ramsey and Jeff Summers.</p>
				        
        	        <h2>Feasibility Study Results for New Golf Course in Midland County</h2>
                	<p>In an August 2024 meeting, Midland County Commissioners reviewed the results of a feasibility study presented by <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-conway-80aa5a10/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Daniel Conway</a> from THK Associates. The study outlined the costs and options for a new golf course in Midland County.  THK estimates demand of 600,000 rounds of golf annually in the Permian Basin with 410,000 rounds at public courses.</p>
    	            	<p>The proposed site for the new golf facility is part of a 234-acre parcel on the northwest corner of County roads 1140 and 110.  The site may also be considered as a potential location for a new county jail and/or water treatment plant.</p>
        	        <p>The study considered 175 acres for the proposed golf course and recommended a 27-hole golf course with a 12,000 square foot clubhouse and 3,500 square foott banquet/meeting space.</p>
                	<p>Estimated costs for the 27-hole course were budgeted for $20 million with irrigation as the most expensive component estimated to range from six million to seven million dollars for 27 holes.  The study projected $4.1 million in annual revenue by the third year for the golf course using the population of the Permian Basin at 450,000 people by 2034.</p>
