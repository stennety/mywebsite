[who's on judge mathis today? #194](https://bitchesgottaeat.substack.com/p/whos-on-judge-mathis-today-194):

> greg dusts off his perry mason costume to say, “aha! that means you believed him, which means he isn’t lying and you’re here on behalf of a thief!” what was that sound? oh yeah, that was my bottom jaw s h a t t e r i n g against the floor. **what a thrilling and hilarious trap!!!!!** i really do be forgetting sometimes that greg is a real live trained lawyer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I love Samantha Irby's recaps of Judge Mathis.
