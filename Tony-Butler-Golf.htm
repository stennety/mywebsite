				<H1>Tony Butler Golf Course - Jeff Blume, ASGCA</H1>
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.tonybutlergc.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Tony Butler Golf Course</a> in Harlingen, Texas, has recently undergone a transformation under the onsite supervision of golf architect, <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://asgca.org/architect/jblume/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jeff Blume</a>.  The municipal renovation project aimed to revitalize the golf course, enhancing both its playability and aesthetics.  Budget for the project escalated to $5.5 million in 2024.  Availability of the golf course founded in 1929 is important to the local community.</p>
				<p>The first phase of the renovation focused on upgrading the infrastructure of the property. Blume redesigned the greens, tees, and bunkers by creating a strategic and engaging layout for golfers at all skill levels.  The introduction of additional tee boxes with as many as 5 per hole offers new playing options, allowing beginners to learn the game. Additionally, the installation of a modern irrigation system ensures optimal turf conditions and efficient water management throughout the course.</p>
				<p>In the second phase, Blume turned his attention to the natural aesthetics and environmental sustainability. Native plants and trees were incorporated into the landscape, enhancing the site's beauty while promoting habitat restoration for local wildlife. Blume also addressed drainage concerns, implementing eco-friendly solutions to minimize stormwater runoff and protect the surrounding ecosystem.</p> 
				<p>As part of the renovation, Blume and the <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.mid-americagolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mid-America Golf Renovation</a> team overhauled the proposed irrigation system to replace an aging 40-year-old network of leaking PVC pipes.  To offset material expenses, the team reduced the number of irrigating sprinkler heads from 1,250 to 830, focusing on areas along the course's outskirts where cutbacks wouldn't impact play.</p>
				<p>The new irrigation system features approximately 14 miles of underground, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) piping.  The new irrigation system is controlled by a centralized computer system.  A significant portion of the renovation project targets the transformation of the golf course's greens to Champions Ultra-Dwarf Bermuda grass, expanding them from about 3,000 to 6,000 square feet with installation of sand base greensmix to replace the old clay-based greens.</p>
