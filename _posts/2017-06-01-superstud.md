Here are some great lines from Paul Feig's book, [Superstud](https://bookshop.org/books/superstud-or-how-i-became-a-24-year-old-virgin/9781400051755):

> What just a few minutes earlier had been my closest friend and comforter was now revealed to have been the serpent in the Garden of Eden.

****

> I had visions of these kids’ sex-crazed dads as drooling, lascivious monsters who had to be locked in cages in their basements next to the furnace and thrown raw meat along with their pornography just to keep their families and neighborhoods safe from their voracious sexual appetites.

****

> I was spending tons of time and energy amassing my collection of G-rated erotica while they were just being handed prepackaged and far more effective collections of masturbation-inducing pictures. It was like finding that after years of hard work and loyal service you had been passed over for promotion by the boss’s idiot son.
