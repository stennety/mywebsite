				<p>The University of Alabama golf facilities upgrade as part of The Crimson Standard initiative is a massive initiative that also includes new facilities for the school’s basketball and gymnastics programs. Preliminary budget for the golf facility is estimated at $26.1 million, including $5.5 million for construction of the new 9 hole course. Also included in the plans are a practice range, short game practice area and golf house used for both the men's and women's teams.  Anticipated completion date is summer 2024.</p>
				<p>The 18,000-square foot golf house would include a Hall of Fame lobby displaying both team's success.  Major Championship winner <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://rolltide.com/sports/mens-golf/roster/justin-thomas/616' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Justin Thomas</a> and 1976 US Open champion <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pate' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jerry Pate</a> are notable Alabama alumni.  Coaches offices, bag storage and club fitting rooms, a team lounge and locker room, stretch room, putting studio and three indoor hitting bays are part of the buildout. North of the clubhouse is a practice range with multiple target greens.  Additionally, there is a new short game practice area would be located west of the clubhouse. The 9 hole golf course is east of the golf house and offers multiple routing options for on-course practice.
