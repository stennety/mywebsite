# 1 THE REAL AND COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEMS

## INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Example
 Prove that 
$$
p^{2} = 2 
$$ is not satisfied by any rational p.

#### Proof
Assume that p is a rational number such that $p = m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime and $n \not = 0$.
Then $p^{2} = 2$ implies 
$$
m^{2} = 2n^{2}
$$
$\implies m^{2}$ is even. 
$\implies m$ is even (If $m$ were odd, $m^{2}$ would be odd).
$\implies m$ is divisible by 4.
$\implies 2n^{2}$ is also divisible by 4.
$\implies n^{2}$ is even.
$\implies n$ is even.

This contradicts the assumption that $m, n$ are relatively prime.
Hence $p^{2} = 2$ is impossible for rational $p$.
