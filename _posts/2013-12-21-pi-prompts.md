Getting to grips with the Raspberry Pi over the holidays and found it quickly became tiresome to keep having to resort to Googling and flicking through a guide to find basic commands, then later on a scribbled piece of paper.

The piece of paper became [Pi Prompts](http://plfstr.github.io/pi-prompts/) - presented much more professionally and hosted on GitHub. Hope it is of use to others starting out with their Pi’s.
