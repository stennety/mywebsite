title: Making money shouldn't be so hard
---

<p>An elderly woman called in about a website she had "bought". A nice man called her approximately two months earlier and said that for only $10,000, his company would sell her a website that would make her money. After the money was sent to the nice man, he mysteriously stopped taking the woman's calls.</p>

**Me**: So what exactly were you going to be selling?<br />
**Woman**: He told me I'd be selling products and that every time someone came to the website, I would get paid.<br />
**Me**: Right. But what were you selling on this website?<br />
**Woman**: I told you! Products?<br />
**Me**: You don't know, do you?<br />
**Woman**: *silent*<br />

About six months later, the woman called again about another website she had "bought".
