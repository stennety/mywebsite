From Filip Bondy's [book about the Pine Tar Game:](https://bookshop.org/books/the-pine-tar-game-the-kansas-city-royals-the-new-york-yankees-and-baseball-s-most-absurd-and-entertaining-controversy/9781476777184) 

> And then Martin made a move that led to one of my favorite baseball moments: At the start of the game, Martin had reliever George Frazier appeal the play at first, claiming Brett had missed the bag during his home-run trot. When that was denied, Frazier appealed that Brett had missed second base and then appealed that Brett had missed third base. After all that, Martin stormed out of the dugout to shout there was no possible way the umpiring crew — a new umpiring crew — could know whether Brett had touched all the bases. Ha! Martin had them!</p>
> 
> Only he didn’t. Home-plate umpire Dave Phillips pulled out a piece of paper and handed it to Martin.</p>
> 
> It was a notarized affidavit from the previous umpiring crew stating unequivocally that Brett had touched all the bases.</p>
