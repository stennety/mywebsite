Back before I met my white American wife, my parents were allegedly looking for a match. I said fine because it's not like I was meeting anyone I liked on my own. Then I found out that they'd actually just created a profile for me on a matrimonial site. I was annoyed but I saw an opportunity.

I told my mom and dad that my requirements were that the woman needed to have a MD and be a specialist. No general practice doctors. They asked for the age range I wanted; I replied the older the better. My mom asked me how I could be with someone older and asked why I needed a specialist; I replied it was because I required a 10000 square foot house. They asked why I needed that; I replied so I didn't always have to look at her stupid face.

They both said I wasn't taking the process seriously and left me alone after that.
