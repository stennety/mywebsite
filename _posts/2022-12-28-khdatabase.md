We are pleased to welcome the [**Kingdom Hearts Database**](https://www.khdatabase.com/) to the Gaming Wiki Network!

The **Kingdom Hearts Database** is a project that works to provide the ultimate source for news, information, and media from the Kingdom Hearts series. It works to document and preserve a wide-range of content, including lore, gameplay data, news, scripts, media, interviews, development history, and more related to the Kingdom Hearts series.

P.S.: Funnily enough, the KH Database is the 13th member of our organization... [get it](https://www.khdatabase.com/Organization_XIII)? ;)
