## Finalist European Lights of the future

LEDfin was entered into the **European Lights of the Future** competition in 2004. It attained a place as a finalist in the student design category and as such was displayed at the Messe international trade show in Frankfurt that year. It appears in the show catalogue.

## Second in the Student Lighting Design competition

It went on to achieve second place in the *UK Student Lighting Design Competition* held by the Lighting Association. The first time my university had attained an award in the competition.

## LEDFin featured in Light, Light and Design and ID magazines

The lamp was also featured in _Light, Light and Design_ and _ID_ magazines. Perhaps as excitingly I received one of those giant cheques usually reserved for charity press events.
