We are pleased to welcome the **Old World Blues Wiki** as our latest member!

The **Old World Blues Wiki** is a wiki about the mod of the same name for the Paradox grand strategy game Hearts of Iron IV. The mod is set in the world of the Fallout video game series, featuring aspects from both the mainline games, the spin-offs, as well as fan-made expansions on regions and locations, to create a thematic exploration of post-nuclear ethics in a war-torn wasteland.
