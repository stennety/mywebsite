*Enjoy Nintendo with Ant & Dec* was part of Nintendo’s multi-million pound ad campaign in Q4 of 2009. This content ‘hub’ of the GAME website was produced to a tight deadline against strict brand guidelines from Nintendo and the use of the Ant and Dec’s imagery. 

Featuring strong visual ties with Nintendo’s marketing campaign, the design also visually emulates the console hardware buttons. 

This composite image shows the various tabs of the hub, these promotional panels displayed above each featured product category.
