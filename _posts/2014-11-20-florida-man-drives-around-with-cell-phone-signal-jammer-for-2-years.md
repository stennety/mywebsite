title: Florida man drives around with cell phone signal jammer for 2 years
---
This is a pretty funny/interesting story that I heard on the [Security Now podcast](http://twit.tv/show/security-now) earlier today. This wannabe vigilante drove around for 2 years on the highways in Florida with a cell phone signal jammer in his SUV, which is VERY illegal because it blocks emergency services. Cell networks are designed in a way that makes it easy to detect interference (MetroPCS noticed that their signals were regularly flatlining on the same stretch of highway twice a day), but it took awhile to track this guy down. When the police pulled him over to arrest him, they noticed that their radios had lost all contact with dispatch. He's not facing any jail time, but IS looking at a $48,000 penalty from the FCC for his antics.
