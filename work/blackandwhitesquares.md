### If it’s black, white and grid-like it has a place here.

In 2009 I launched blackandwhitesqaures.com, a site dedicated to QR (Quick Response) and 2D barcodes, showing the best of what they can do. 

Two posts featured under Tumblr’s very popular and curated [#tech tag](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/tech), generating great traffic and quadrupling follower count. 

B&WS content grew to 450+ posts before I archived the site in 2017.

The site was also a usefull testbed for SEO techniques, experience copywriting, producing and sourcing content around marketing, business and technology.

B&WS was built using a custom designed, self-built theme, on the Tumblr platform.
