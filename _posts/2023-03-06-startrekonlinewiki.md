Today we are welcoming the **Star Trek Online Wiki** as the newest member of our Gaming Wiki Network.

The Star Trek Online Wiki is a publicly accessible and editable website for gathering useful information related to Star Trek Online. The wiki is a flexible web-based database of information made up entirely of user contributions, utilizing MediaWiki software.

In February 2023, the admin team at Star Trek Online Wiki decided to break away from Fandom, Inc. They elected to establish a new wiki, stowiki.net, created from a branch of the existing “Official Star Trek Online Wiki”.
