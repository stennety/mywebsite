				<H1>Los Alamos Golf - Muni Renovation</H1>
				<p>Course reopening partially in September 2024.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.losalamosnm.us/Parks-and-Recreation/Recreation/Recreation-Facilities-Activities/Golf-Course' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Los Alamos County Golf Course</a> is undergoing a renovation plan in 2024 led by Forrest Richardson and Todd Schoeder to improve the entire golf course with a $4 million budget, including improvements to the cart paths, new greens with redesigned contours, bunkers, driving range and practice area. Richardson and Schoeder will also be looking at the reversal and redesign of holes 7 and 8, as important to the safety of traffic on adjacent Diamond Drive.  Superintendent Mike Lippiatt, GCSAA(Golf Course Superintendents Association of America), is overseeing the build out and anticipates December 2024 fully completed opening date.</p>
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.mid-americagolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mid America Golf</a> is leading golf construction efforts for the historic course nestled in the heart of the Jemez Mountains. Built in 1947, the new routing from the back tees will tip out at 6,759 yards at par 72.</p>
				<p>Tee complex strategy and course yardage will be updated to modern standards by spacing out the yardage and provide the same playing experience for golfers of all abilities. Drainage issues on the greens will be addressed and fixing these issues. Forward tees have been neglected in the past and will be made larger with more appropriate yardages.  Harold Anthony Strain from the Municipal Public Works Department is the project manager.</p>
				<p>Bunkers on the golf course have not drained well historically and have had maintenance upkeep issues.  They will be completely redone as part of the improvements.  Newly paved concrete cart path have been installed on holes 16-18.</p>

Richardson in recent times has been proposing projects at Brookside in Pasadena, California and Pajaro Valley in Northern California which rethinks the footprint of the golf course with re-routing hole possibilities.

In addition to designing new courses, Richardson has also worked on restoring existing courses, such as the Berkeley Country Club in El Cerrito, California, which was originally designed by Robert Hunter, and the Wigwam Golf Club - Gold Course in Litchfield Park, Arizona, which was originally designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr. He has also remodeled the Arizona Biltmore Golf Club in Phoenix, Arizona, which was originally designed by William P. Bell.</p>
