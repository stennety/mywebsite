The links-style course will be designed by Thomas McBroom and Doug Carrick. The new course will feature dramatic ocean views using the tumbling terrain with smaller scale pot bunkers to emphasize strategy. Expected opening is spring 2025.</p><p>Tiger Woods visited Fox Harb'r Golf Resort in Nova Scotia on behalf of the Tiger Woods Foundation, playing 2 rounds of golf.  Tiger shot a course record of 63.  Tiger noted highlights of the layout with how quiet and peaceful the environment is.</p>"
