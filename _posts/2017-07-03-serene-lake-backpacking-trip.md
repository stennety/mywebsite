This past weekend, my friends and I did a 16-ish mile backpacking trip to Serene Lake, in the Mt. Hood Wilderness. It was beautiful there, and there were plenty of camping spots. The bugs were pretty bad, so I'd recommend definitely bringing bug spray.

We started at [this trailhead](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Shellrock_Lake_Trailhead), hiked to [Serene Lake](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Rock_Lakes-Serene_Lake_Loop_Hike), then looped back.

Here's some drone footage that I shot from the ridge above the lake:
