[First](https://www.gq.com/story/your-morning-shot-deion-sanders), a great quote from Deion Sanders:

> "If you look good, you feel good. If you feel good, you play good. If you play good, they pay good."

[Second](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/dpwa7w/i-played-the-boys-are-back-in-town-on-a-bar-jukebox-until-i-got-kicked-out-832), a man plays “The Boys Are Back In Town” on a bar’s jukebox until he gets kicked out:

> I left with a full heart, flush with new knowledge about the town, and the boys within it, who now would never leave, and word of whom I had spread around. I would also be severely late to work the next morning

[Third](https://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-mtblog-2008-01-a_threadbare_aristocracy-story.html), H.L. Mencken once said something about the American public that’s still very applicable:

> Here [in the United States] the general average of intelligence, of knowledge, of competence, of integrity, of self-respect, of honor is so low that any man who knows his trade, does not fear ghosts, has read fifty good books, and practices the common decencies stands out as brilliantly as a wart on a bald head, and is thrown willy-nilly into a meager and exclusive aristocracy.
