#.net reads
##What's .net reads?
.net (dotnet) reads is some kind of monthly writting topic that I would to like to do on my personal web page. I'll try to write a few more times to share with you something about the .net ecossystem that I might find interesting and that some other people that I know/follow may be also writing about.

##.NET Core 3.0 Preview
The new .net core 3.0 Preview is available right now, you can find it on [.NET Core 3.0 downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) web page. You can go there and dowload it to try.
So the main changes on .NET Core 3.0.0 Preview 2 are:
* ASP.NET Core 3.0 Preview 2
* EF Core 3.0 Preview 2
* C# 8 Preview 2 (see highlights in the blog post)
* .NET Platform Dependent Intrinsics
* JSON Writer and JSON Document
* Local dotnet tool improvements
* Assembly Unloadability
* Windows native interop
* Work continues on WinForms and WPF
* API changes for Preview 2

##Polly
Recentlly I was able to view a presentation on [Building resilient applications with Polly.NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FglpmSalC8) on youtube, by Nuno Caneco at [netponto community](http://netponto.org/)  on how to build a .NET resilient app. The presentation and content are in Portuguese, so it would be difficult to understand it if you don't speak portuguese.

It was the first time I heard bout Polly and I liked it!

##.NET Foundation
The [.net foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) is an independent organization to promote innovation and to improve the future of .NET ecosystem. If you are a .NET developer and you don't know ahout .NET Foundation or you don't follow it, take a look about it on the official web site.
