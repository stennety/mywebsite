title: Testing xpath selectors with FireFinder
---
I was in need of a tool to test out some XPath selectors for the Selenium framework I'm using as part of a project I'm working on, when I stumbled upon [FireFinder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefinder-for-firebug/). This is an add-on for Firebug, so it's only compatible with Firefox. It's extremely useful, though, for testing out XPath selectors. Definitely recommend it for web developers.
