This tweet passed by in [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/plfstr) feed one day:

> There are, like, 110 unique tags in HTML5. Do people seriously memorize them all? Because I haven’t. I wrote about some tactics to improve semantics, whether you've memorized all the tags or not - featuring my recent discovery: the `<meter>` element! – [Leslie Cohn-Wein](https://twitter.com/lesliecdubs/status/1305503826166927360?s=20) (@lesliecdubs)

I thought to myself, <q>That's a lot to remember. I wonder if there's a game that tests you?</q>

A web search and lack of a results later... [HTML Tags Memory Test](https://codepen.io/plfstr/full/zYqQeRw) was created! 

## HTML elements to test you

{% include codepen.html codepen="zYqQeRw" height="350" %}

The app is built with plain JavaScript, the recalled total counts down as you make your HTML element guesses, which join a list of correct answers. 

The design is brutally styled using only [named colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors), to suit the bare HTML element, retro theme. It has a dark theme too, depending on your preference and how long it takes you to recall the elements!

_To create the initial elements array, before I found a list of HTML elements, I tried to remember as many as I could. I made it to 74. If I took more time, perhaps 80–90. The more exotic table element tags, typography and embed tags, were the elements I had trouble recalling. I would be amazed if anyone could remember 100%._

It's the time-sink 2020 needs.
