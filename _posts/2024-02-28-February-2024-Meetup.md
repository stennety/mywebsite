## News Round-up

### MicroPython v1.22.2 Patch release for rp2 DMA, UART and BLE; esp32 BLE; renesas-ra I2C

### Using a Raspberry Pi Pico to Enhance a Vintage Radio Shack Microcomputer Kit

Can a vintage microcontroller from 1985 run MicroPython? Of course not! Especially not one with a 4-bit architecture and 512 _bits_ of RAM. But, [this All About Circuits project using the Radio Shack Science Fair Microcomputer Trainer coupled to a Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/using-a-raspberry-pi-pico-to-enhance-a-vintage-radio-shack-microcomputer-kit/) serves as a great introduction to how simple computers work.

![2024-02-28_meetup_radioshack.jpg](../images/2024-02-28_meetup_radioshack.jpg)

* Interesting intoduction to the Texas Instruments TMS1100, a very simple system-on-chip microcontroller (and claimed to be the first such chip)

### MPRemote Visual Studio Code Extension

> The goal of the MPRemote extension for Visual Studio Code is to give easy point and click access to many of the functions of the MicroPython project's MPRemote command-line tool. Rather than typing commands in a separate window, you simply navigate to them using the VS Code user interface.

* Thanks to Dave, [DavesCodeMusings on GitHub](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings)
* Have a look at [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/mpremote-vscode) or [detailed wiki page](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/mpremote-vscode/wiki) for more info

### Driving a LEGO car with an Xbox controller

Laurens Valk [has showed off driving a remote control car](https://fosstodon.org/@laurensvalk/111951571623325379) using LEGO Pybricks system attached to an Xbox controller

![2024-02-28_meetup_lego-xbox-pybricks.jpg](../images/2024-02-28_meetup_lego-xbox-pybricks.jpg)

* We're going to try and get this running in the session today! We'll take photos if we get it working…
* Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxInp9cutNg)
* [Pybricks](https://pybricks.com/) is MicroPython and block coding for LEGO hubs

### Crickets in (a northern hemisphere) February

Stewart C. Russell (scruss) has a new project guide on [using some Raspberry Pi Picos to make sounds like crickets](https://scruss.com/blog/2024/02/19/crickets-in-february/) do, including adapting the chirp rate depending on the temperature

![2024-02-28_meetup_crickets.jpg](../images/2024-02-28_meetup_crickets.jpg)

* Makes more sense when you know he lives in Canada! (it's cold there in February...)
* Good as an introductory lesson on doing a simple algorithm in MicroPython and interfacing that to some hardware

### Make Your Pet Hexapod

Who _doesn't_ want a 3D printed walking mechanical insect??

### Notifications to water your pot plants

WizNet have [published a quick project demo](https://maker.wiznet.io/viktor/projects/how-to-monitor-your-plant-with-w5100s-evb-pico/?page=3&serob=mv&serterm=all) using one of their Ethernet boards to get Telegram messages when your pot plants need to be watered

### Closing Thought

  From [@markb139](https://twitter.com/markb139) [on X](https://twitter.com/markb139/status/1753061279797788681):

  > At one point I was debugging a C extension to micropython in one vscode and debugging python code in another. It was at that point I realised what an amazing set of low cost tools we have access to
