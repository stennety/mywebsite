				<H1>Lake Oswego Muni Golf - Dan Hixson</H1>
				<p>Just south of Portland, the City of Lake Oswego Municipal Golf Course undertook a multi-year renovation project and reopened in April 2025.   The municipal project which was funded by the 2019 Lake Oswego Bond Measure including the construction of a new maintenance grounds building, an updated driving range, and rebuild of the existing 18-hole Par 3 course to a full 9-hole executive course designed by <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-hixson-3b2a25178/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Dan Hixson</a>.</p>
				<p>The new maintenance facility is being rebuilt on the north side of the property adjacent to Stafford Road.  A major part of the maintenanace budget and upgrade for the grounds is a new irrigation system.  Total cost of the municipal renovation project was estimated to be $12 million and was overseen by the City's Parks and Recreation Department.  Published in August 2024, initial weekend 9 hole green fees will be $26.</p>
				<p>Brian Henninger from the PGA Tour is helping with the renovation project by serving as a consultant to the project, providing input on the design of the new course. Henninger is an Oregon native and member of the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame.  He is familiar with the Lake Oswego course and is quoted: 'I'm excited to be involved in the renovation of the Lake Oswego Municipal Golf Course. It's a great course with a lot of potential, and I think we can make it even better. I'm looking forward to working with the City and the design team to create a course that's challenging and enjoyable for golfers of all skill levels.'</p>
