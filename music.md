An abridged listing of music I am either involved in making, or listen to a lot.

## Dandelion Gold

Dandelion Gold is the recording and music production studio where me and my husband Johnny Goss have created and recorded a lot of music over the years.  The links below are just a small slice.  There is a lot more you can [here](https://www.dandeliongold.com/work){:target="_blank"}.

Some highlights from me and Johnny:

### Cock & Swan

Cock & Swan is the main music project that me and Johnny have worked on together since 2006.

#### Studio Performances & Other Music Videos

My favorite kind of 'live' performance to do is in our recording studio.  A couple of the videos below are examples of this.  They are all directed, recorded and produced by both Johnny and very special musical/artistic guests and friends.

* [Cock & Swan - Rabbit's Dream (Live Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_33Wg-8Kt0){:target="_blank"}
* [Cock & Swan - PERG (Honing) (Live Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0R178RFlxE){:target="_blank"}
* [Cock & Swan - Animal Totem (JOFT) (Mono Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXsV4NdwJ2U){:target="_blank"}
* [Cock & Swan - Melt Down (WUND)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvtilgCrdug){:target="_blank"}

#### Music Videos I've Edited

One of my other favorite things to do is edit existing footage to our music.  Aeon Flux, John Carpenter movies, and Vash the Stampede have all made an appearance.

* [Cock & Swan x TZECHAR - Taken Apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsJXyzoiReM){:target="_blank"}

* [Cock & Swan - Looking Out (Brian Binning Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvxs80ePzwk){:target="_blank"}

### Johnny's Composition Work

Johnny also composes music for video games and other artistic projects such as contemporary dance.  His [2022 Composition Reel](https://youtu.be/_x7fZeSbu1E){:target="_blank"} gives you a taste of a variety of projects.  I need to make him a new version soon.  I am always impressed by how versatile Johnny can be when creating music, and it still sounds exactly like something he would do.
