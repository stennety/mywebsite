**Muneer**: I just want the Supreme Court nomination ceremony to end up being like the opening scene in King Ralph.<br>
**Steve**: That takes me back.<br>
**Muneer**: Instead of it all happening at once, it can happen over a few weeks or months.<br>
**Muneer**: But at the end of the day, a Canadian named Gordie Ashton will be named president.  He will bring moose and Tim Hortons along with social programs.<br>
**Lisette**: Haaa.<br>
**Steve**: I, for one, welcome our Canadian overlords.<br>
**Muneer**: Brought up my King Ralph scenario to some pals at work. They pointed out that Gordie Ashton is ineligible to be the president since he's Canadian.<br>
I feel like Gordie being the illegitimate son of a rogue American diplomat confers automatic American citizenship upon him.<br>
**Lisette**: Yeah there’s a little thing called dual citizenship. Tired of these birthers.<br>
**Muneer**: Exactly!!
