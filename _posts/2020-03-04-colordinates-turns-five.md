[Colordinates](/blog/colordinates/), my web app which gives a colour value based on your geographic location, has turned 5 years old.

{% include codepen.html codepen="https://codepen.io/plfstr/pen/rarJov" height="500" %}

What started out as an excuse to use the Geolocation API, is approaching _almost_ 5,000 views and 50 likes on CodePen and is available as an offline PWA (Progressive Web App).

## Where The Hue Are You?

Colordinates app features on several PWA stores:

* [PWA Directory](/blog/colordinates-in-pwa-directory/)
* Outweb.io
* Appsco.pe
* Pwa.co

I have detailed the work I have done [improving Colordinates accessibility](/blog/colordinates-app-a11y/), as I continue to work on the project as part of my [side project learning](/blog/side-project-learning/).
