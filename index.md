# Rames Nagib AlJneibi - رامس نجيب الجنيبي

Welcome to my personal academic blog and portfolio. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Machine Learning and preparing for a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I’m passionate about uncovering deep structures in data and mathematics and applying them to real-world systems. 

I previously earned my Master’s in Mathematics and a Bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering. Professionally, I’ve worked across engineering, planning, and strategic roles in the Gas Business where I integrate technical expertise with long-term energy outlooks.

## Research & Interests

My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of:

- **Machine Learning & Time-Series Forecasting**  
- **Optimization & Applied Mathematics**  
- **Uncertainty Quantification and Conformal Prediction**  
- **Energy Systems Planning & Gas Infrastructure**  
- **Stochastic PDEs and Mathematical Modeling**

I’m currently focusing my Master’s thesis on **Conformal Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification**, while also exploring the intersection of **Numerical Methods for PDEs** and **Machine Learning**.  

My broader ambition is to contribute to the development of rigorous, real-world **mathematical models of physical systems**, bridging theory and application in meaningful ways.

## Vision

I believe that robust mathematical thinking is a superpower in today’s world — and I’m working toward becoming a **pioneer in data-driven decision-making** for energy and industrial systems. My goal is to lead impactful, intelligent solutions in one of the most critical sectors for global development.

## Professional History

- Senior Specialist – Gas Master Planning (Energy Sector) (2024–current)
- Senior Production Planning Engineer – ADNOC Gas (2022–2024)
- Process Engineer – ADNOC Refining (2019–2021)

## Academic Journey

While working full-time in a demanding technical and strategic role, I pursued my Master’s in Mathematics — and later began a second Master’s in Machine Learning. Despite the load of being a Full-Time student and Full-time Employee, I maintained strong academic performance while receiving promotions and high evaluations at work. That period tested and shaped my discipline, mental resilience, and passion for growth.

It was during this time that I realized my ability to thrive at the intersection of theory and application — and it continues to fuel my vision for impactful, cross-disciplinary work.

## Personal Notes

I’ve always loved helping others learn — whether as an older sibling, classroom tutor, or mentor — and I enjoy breaking down complex ideas into simple, digestible insights.

My love for adventure and challenge extends beyond the academic realm. I’m into fitness and pursue my physical goals with the same discipline I apply to my intellectual ones. I primarily focus on bodybuilding, but I also enjoy long-distance running (even if I barely survive marathons) and challenging hikes that push my limits.

There’s something deeply fulfilling about navigating both mind and body through effort and discomfort — and coming out stronger on the other side.
