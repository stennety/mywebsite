During the last days at my work i had to run couple of kubernetes deployments locally. Therefore i looked into the popular solutions to run kubernetes locally as:
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
* [k3s](https://k3s.io/)

# Situation

I have to run the local kubernetes cluster on my working environment. That's a MacOS laptop with the latest Bir Sur version installed.

# minikube

This is the solutions i known best and used couple of times in the past already and its providing different options to run the local kubernetes cluster like:
* docker
* virtualbox
* and couple of others
