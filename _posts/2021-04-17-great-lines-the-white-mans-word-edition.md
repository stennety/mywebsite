I recently read Dave Parker's new autobiography, *Cobra*. There are tons of good stories in the book, but this one about what happened after a black player was unfairly fined by the league was my favorite:

>Charlie had some idea of what this was about and found George Sisler Jr., son of the great first baseman for the St. Louis Browns, sitting very properly on a stool in the bar. In an extremely stern voice, Sisler demanded to know the details of the incident with Rochester police. Charlie once again was forced to explain himself. Sisler wasn't convinced.

>"Why am I to believe you?"

>"You know why, Mr. Sisler? Because *asshole* is a white man's word. If I was gonna cuss you out, I would have said *motherfucker*."

>Sisler stared at Charlie Boo for a few moments, opened his wallet, and handed him $300.
