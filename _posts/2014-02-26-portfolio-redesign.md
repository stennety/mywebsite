Thats right a nice and new shiny site, complete with blog! So let's break this blog thing into its new home and explain myself...

## What's changed in the redesign?

A welcome injection of colour and a much bolder approach then previously, to meet the trend for larger and high resolution displays. I  tried to embrace flat design and let my work and the content provide the focus. 

I have paired down my work from maybe a dozen pieces spread across three hardcoded categories: web, graphic, product, to just eight pieces of a mix my best stuff. This enables a much more focused sample of my professional work you can experience more simply. More casual pieces from my Tumblog have been brought under one domain. See other [previous posts](/blog/).

Typography is important particularly with the introduction of a blog to proceedings, a more casual sans-serif font - a mix of Geneva and Tahoma - has been chosen along with a strict vertical rhythm to make the site more comfortable to read on any screen.

I kept the left nav, right content arrangement of previous layouts, I felt my mix of work - plus with the blog coming - articles, would keep the balance best and retain the navigation.

The site is now responsive and built with a mobile first principle, so users should only download enough to get the best experience and no more.

## Why change to Kirby CMS?

I enjoy using WordPress, I've been through two site overhauls with it now since WordPress v2.7. It was time for a change. 

*	**Features**: To be honest, my site only used the bare minimal of features that WordPress provides. It was over the top for my needs and the trend will remain so as WordPress transitions from a blogging platform to a full-blown CMS. With my setup now there are just my files, my templates and the content result.

*	**Speed**: I spent a lot of [time last year](/blog/year-in-review-2013/) getting the site faster and faster both myself and with the use of caching. Speed is important and Kirby I hope is going to give me even more. It's more light-weight and performance has been speedy so far, page loads of  approximately 1 second.

*	**Security and Stability**: Every time I manually had to update WP - no so much of an issue lately with automatic updates - there was always a knot in my stomach that I would get the dreaded white screen. By ridding myself of the DB and a single point of failure I don't have that to worry about any more. 

*	**Markdown**: I am also enjoying experiencing writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), it is very quick to familiarise with and begin writing very fast. I don't feel compelled to get the (html) markup in order as I write. So far I am really enjoying writing in Markdown it's much faster.

* 	**Something New**: Its a new way of working, and new files to get stuck into and optimise to the way I want to work and maintain this site.

It seems I am not the only one, I got a subtle sense perhaps from the rise of GitHub and Jekyll, more recently there have been a lot of blog posts proclaiming 2014 to be the [year of the flat file CMS](http://www.typeandgrids.com/blog/goodbye-wordpress-2014-will-be-the-year-of-flat-file-cmses). *I suddenly feel less of a maverick*.

## Whats ahead?

The site will remain a work in progress, it's easy with a new design and platform to explore the limits straightaway - I tried hard to focus myself and launch with a minimal-ish viable product - I shall be tweaking elements in the background and adding further features for a while to come.

I shall be resuming my CodePen demos and writing some more posts. _Famous last words from so many blogs_.

Hope you enjoying reading.
