My friends and I camped at Crater Lake in July. During that trip, I got a bunch of burst photo sessions of people jumping in. I wanted to blend them like this:

To do this, I use a combination of Photoshop and Lightroom. In Lightroom, I select the photos I want for the blend, right click them, and choose "Edit in" -> "Open as layers in Photoshop."

I then use layer masks to blend them in, like so:
