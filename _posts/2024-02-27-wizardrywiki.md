We are pleased to welcome the **Wizardry Wiki** as the GWN's 20th member! Please join us in welcoming them and celebrating this amazing milestone.

The **Wizardry Wiki** is a wiki about the Wizardry video game franchise, a classic first-person dungeon crawler from 1981. It covers all things from the mainline series by Sirtech, the Japanese developed games, and related materials such as Blade & Bastard (except Wizardry BC). The wiki dates back to 2008 but was forked to wiki.gg in 2023.

Check out the wiki at [https://wizardry.wiki.gg/](https://wizardry.wiki.gg)!
