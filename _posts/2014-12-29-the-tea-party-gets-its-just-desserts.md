At my old job, I’d talk to Tea Party idiots all the time. Since we had to take calls from people if they followed up on stuff, I was able to see the deterioration of their lives in a very concrete way.

The themes of the calls usually went as follows:

**Call 1**: Obama is the worst and everyone besides me is leeching off the system! Why do I have to pay so much in taxes!

**Call 2**: I just lost my job. Does my employer have to keep giving me health insurance?

**Call 3**: I’m about to lose my house. Aren’t there any government programs that can help me?

Few things brought me more joy than seeing these people stuck in a world where their situation was at direct odds with their Tea Party views.
