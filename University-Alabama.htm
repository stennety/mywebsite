				<p>The University of Alabama golf facilities upgrade as part of The Crimson Standard initiative is a massive initiative that also includes new facilities for the schoolâ€™s basketball and gymnastics programs. Preliminary budget for the golf facility is estimated at $26.1 million, including $5.5 million for construction of the new 9 hole course named Crimson Reserve with RainBird irrigation controls. Also included in the plans are a practice range, short game practice area and golf house used for both the men's and women's teams.  Opening date: September 2024</p>
				<p>The 18,000-square foot golf house would include a Hall of Fame lobby displaying both team's success.
