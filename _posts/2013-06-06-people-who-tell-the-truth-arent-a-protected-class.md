title: People who tell the truth aren't a protected class

<p>A woman called in about being discriminated against at work because she was African American. She said that her manager was not giving her the same hours as all the other employees. I sent her a questionnaire to fill out to get more detail about the case. About a week later, I got the paperwork back and called her. She sent in a work schedule as part of her packet.</p>

**Me**: I am looking at this schedule, and I see that there is a Sheneneh and Laquanda [names changed]. May I presume that they're African American as well?<br>
**Woman**: Yup.<br>
**Me**: I also see that they are getting 40 hours a week.<br>
**Woman**: That's because they're friends with the boss.<br>
**Me**: That really sinks your case. You can't claim racial discrimination if there are other people of the same race getting 40 hours a week. If these women were all getting reduced hours, then we might have something.<br>
**Woman**: If I get fired, do I get unemployment?<br>
**Me**: Not unless we can prove discrimination. Which we can't.<br>
**Woman**: Well I'm going to apply anyway.<br>
**Me**: You are free to do so. The likelihood of you getting benefits is low.

<p>She called back in a month later about being denied for unemployment. The reason for her getting fired? Telling her boss "the truth".</p>
