Few things in history are as compelling as the duel. Refined and barbaric at the same time, this practice has had a checkered history. The rules of dueling were codified by the Irish in 1777 in the Code Duello ([summarized here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/sfeature/rulesofdueling.html)), which was codified at Clonmel Summer Assizes in 1777\. 

As evidenced by these [documents](http://faculty.columbiabasin.edu/faculty/dabbott/DuelloDox.htm), dueling was in practice prior to the Irish rules being drafted. The procedure and philosophy behind duels is illustrated in [this article](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~wew/fencing/philosophy.html).
