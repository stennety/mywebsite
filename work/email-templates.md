I have designed and coded a lot of direct email marketing pieces and customer communication templates across the various brands [I have worked for](/cv/):

## Street Fighter

Street Fighter IV game was an old game brought up-to-date whilst paying homage to the original characters and gameplay. My design aimed to do the same, with the big bold graphical style a derivative of this aesthetic. I was provided with some great artwork so I chose to make the opening graphic as big and bold as the game itself.

The Street Fighter series was back and I wanted to make sure customers opening this mailer knew it and immediately pre-ordered.

## GamePlay Templates

GAME and Gameplay customers were dedicated to gaming and brand loyal. Tasked with bringing the customer email templates up-to-date, I designed the customer communications and transactional emails to be really bold and dynamic in keeping with the brands.

Gameplays (seen above) site made enthusiastic use of frame detailing for each section of the site, I retained this aesthetic but achieved it in a more measured way.
