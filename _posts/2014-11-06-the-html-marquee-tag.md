title: The HTML "Marquee" tag
---
"Marquee" is a somewhat esoteric HTML tag introduced in Internet Explorer 3 that is used to create a scrolling area of text. It has a direction attribute that specifies the direction that the text should move in. The text can also be set to bounce around when it hits the end of its scroll area.

I created [this example](http://jsfiddle.net/dmerica/bcyr75o0/2/) on JSFiddle to demonstrate.

The marquee tag is not valid according to any HTML specification. It is, however, supported in most browsers.
