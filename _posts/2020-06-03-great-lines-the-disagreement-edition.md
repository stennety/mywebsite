[From Shane Parrish](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/06/the-four-tools-of-discipline/):

> …The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is that we just assume they are ignorant. You know, they don’t have access to the same information we do and when we generously share that information with them, they are going to see the light and come on over to our team.
> 
> When that doesn’t work. When it turns out those people have all the same information and they still don’t agree with us we move onto a second assumption. They’re idiots. They have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together.
> 
> And when that doesn’t work. When it turns out that people have all the same facts that we do and they are pretty smart we move onto a third assumption. They know the truth and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.
> 
> So this is a catastrophe our: attachment to our own rightness. It prevents us from preventing mistakes when we need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.”

[Third](https://www.westword.com/news/72-hour-party-people-5075797), a 72 hour Asian meth party in Denver and Las Vegas:

> Back at Nick's house, there are Otter Pop wrappers everywhere. Otter Pop wrappers on the hardwood floors, on the kitchen tile, on the toilet seats in all the bathrooms, in the sinks, on the turntables, on the couch cushions. They are hard, plastic, sticky, omnipresent evidence that something very strange and very wicked went down in this place.
