Hi, I'm Łukasz, more widely known on the Internet as dreat

### What do I do?

I'm a software monk, delivering high quality software with zen.
On a path to programming polyglot.
Professionally using Elixir, possibly some Erlang, my two programming loves. 

I'm a drummer, already with one album recorded as a session drummer. If you want me to drum, contact me.

I'm a music designer, I play around Ableton to make mostly dark ambient and I'm developing my SonicPi skills.
