			<h1>David McLay Kidd Golf in Texas Hill Country</h1>
				<p>The <a href='http://dmkgolfdesign.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>David McLay Kidd</a>  18 hole golf course being built at Loraloma is anticipated to be a par 72 golf course that is planned to fit seamlessly into the natural terrain of the Texas Hill Country along the western shore of the Perdenales River. The course will feature a wide variety of holes ranging from long, challenging par-4s to short, challenging risk-reward par-3 holes.  The USGA specification greens are anticipated to be large and undulating.  The zoysia sodded fairways are expected to be lined with native grasses and wildflowers, among them Texas bluebonnets.   The course will have views of the surrounding Texas Hill Country, including the Pedernales River and the Balcones Escarpment.  Kidd has designed over golf courses around the world, notably Bandon Dunes Golf Resort in Oregon and Nanea in Hawaii.  Golf course at Loraloma is slated to open at the end of 2024. It will be a private course with memberships available to residents of Loraloma and Thomas Ranch.</p>
