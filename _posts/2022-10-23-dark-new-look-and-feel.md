If you're a returning visitor, first of all, Thank You!, you might have already noticed things look a little different.

I have updated the theme I am using from [Architect](https://pages-themes.github.io/architect/) to [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). This brings a number of useful features:

* Dark mode (optional)
* Search
* Categories
* Archives

All posts now live in a /posts/ directory, and I managed to setup redirects using [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) for all existing posts, so links should still work. If you run into a broken link, please let me know.

I'm still working on getting the tags and catagories right. I expect I'll continue to refine them over time.

I hope you enjoy the new look and feel, please let me know what you think.
