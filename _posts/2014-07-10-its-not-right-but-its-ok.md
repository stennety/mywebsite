title: It's not right, but it's OK
---

Today, I conclusively proved to my wife that if something is not O.K., it is right. If we accept noted logician Whitney Houston's 1999 theorem, "It's Not Right, But It's OK", then we must accept that the converse is also true, ergo if it's not OK, it's right. Me FTW.Some great comments on this post:**Lisa**: Fail. Ms. Houston was not suggesting that all things that are "not right" are "ok." In fact, the very subject of her song suggests that there are things that are both not right and not ok. Ergo, the logic that all things that are not ok are right doesn't quite work....but she's gonna make it anyway, so don't you worry!**Jes**: A partial counter proof conclusively establishing the implicative ambiguity of Houston's association:
