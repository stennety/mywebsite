Warren G's song "Regulate" has inspired a couple of epic summaries. 

First, this is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulate_(song)#Synopsis):

> Warren G is driving alone through Eastside, Long Beach, California at night, looking for women. He finds a group of men playing dice and tries to join them, but they pull out their guns and rob him instead. Thinking he's about to die, Warren G sings out, "if I had wings I would fly"; one critic describes this moment as "the hook" of the song.

> Meanwhile, Nate Dogg is looking for Warren G. He passes a car full of women, who are so fixated on him that they crash their car. He finds Warren G and shoots at the robbers, dispersing them. The two friends then return to the women and ride away with them, with the intent of taking them to the "Eastside motel".

>In the third verse, Warren and Nate explain their G-funk musical style; the song "constructs itself as inaugurating a new era"

Next, Sean Keane wrote my f[avorite rap synopsis](https://web.archive.org/web/20040418220919/http://zembla.cementhorizon.com/archives/000656.html) ever:

> The toughness and unstoppability of 213 also appears to be purely a function of Nate Dogg's badness and/or motherfuckerness. Saying that 213 is difficult to step to is sort of like saying that Barry Bonds and Benito Santiago combined to hit 62 home runs last year: it's true, but somewhat deceptive. Both Dogg and Bonds would be intimidating regardless of their partners. Dogg may as well say "Nate Dogg and Sean Keane have to regulate;" at least I've still got my watch.
