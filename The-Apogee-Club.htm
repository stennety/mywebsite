			<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.apogeeclub.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>The Apogee Club</a> is a 1,218-acre private golf club located on the west and east side of SW Kanner Highway.  The property is north of SW Bridge Road in Stuart.  The club includes three 18-hole golf courses with extensive practice range and short game facilities, a par 3 course.  The property will have no permanent residential units.  The original application was submitted in 2021 with Martin County staff report issued on March 2022. The county report recommended that the <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://owl.martin.fl.us/app/f?p=301:2:9510676890564::::P2_LIST_GROUP_ID,P2_LIST_ID:693,11657' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Martin County Commission</a> approved the application with the benefit of an open space and up to 54 golf cottages for members and guests.  Before approving the start of construction of the golf courses, the Martin County Commission held a public hearing on the application in 2022.</p>

He is the founder and CEO of Apogee Club.  Davis is the former CEO of the United States Golf Association (USGA).  Davis began his career at the USGA in 1990 as the assistant manager of championship relations.  He was promoted to senior director of USGA Rules and Competitions in 2005, then became the USGA's 7th executive director in 2011.  In 2016, Davis was named the USGA's first Chief Executive Officer.  As executive director and CEO of the USGA, Davis oversaw all aspects of the organization's operations.  He also served as a member of several golf-related boards, including the International Golf Federation, World Golf Foundation, World Golf Hall of Fame, and Official World Golf Ranking(OWGR).  Mike Davis is a highly respected figure in the golf world.  He is known for his expertise in golf course setup, and he has been responsible for setting up the courses for all of the USGA's championships, including the U.S. Open.</p>
			<p>Mike Davis is onsite managing the construction of the project.  Davis has recruited an elite team, namely Anthony Nysse as Director of Golf Courses & Grounds.  <a style='font-weight:bold'  href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-nysse-523a67b0/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Anthony Nysse</a> has previous experience as leader in agronomy at Mountain Lake, Old Marsh, Pine Tree, and Colonial Country Club.  Davis partnered with Mike Pascucci and Steve Ross at the outset of the project.</p>
			<p>Golf architects working on the 3 golf courses are Gil Hanse(West), Tommy Fazio with Mike Davis(South), and Kyle Phillips(North) initial opening in autumn 2023.  The club will have 2 driving ranges, including a 360 degreee range and practice facility.  Rory McIlroy, Ernie Els, and Bradley Klein have complimented the property.  TifTuf Bermuda grass, developed by the University of Georgia through a rigorous testing and development process, is used in the fairways. TifTuf is known for its superior qualities in turf quality and water requirements.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.rainbird.com/golf/products/integrated-control-system/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Rainbird Irrigation Control(IC) System</a> has been chosen onsite.  TifEagle was developed by the University of Georgia in Tifton, Georgia in conjunction with the <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/tifton-ga/crop-genetics-and-breeding-research/docs/bermudagrass-for-turf/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS)</a>.  Advantages of TifEagle are its fine texture and density - TifEagle has a finer leaf texture and higher shoot density compared to other bermuda grass varieties leading to smoother putting surfaces.  TifEagle can tolerate extremely low mowing heights at 1/8 inch or 3.2 mm helping create the smooth, fast surfaces preferred on greens.   Additionally, TifEagle is highly tolerant of heat making it suitable for use in hot, sunny climates. It remains green and healthy even during the height of summer.</p>
			<p>Early reports from Hanse's West course have classic design elements from sandy soil in a Leven inspired short par 4 5th hole and a Hell's Half Acre for heroics at the par 5 6th hole.</p>
