<p>Last night, I was being bullied by my co-workers into bringing treats today. I know it was bullying because I watch Oprah and she knows what she's talking about.</p>

<p>So, I go to Munchers, and ask them for 2 dozen mini cinnamon rolls in a box and then 6 in a paper bag. I walked into the office belligerently holding the paper bag, telling people that their treats are here. I got death stares, looks of confusion and hurt, and outright rage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once I felt that the blood pressure of my co-workers had risen an acceptable amount, I went to my car and got the box. Looks of relief and phrases such as, "I was trying to figure out how I was going to screw you over" flowed in abundance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had mini cinnamon rolls, but also a lesson: Don't bully Muneer.</p>
